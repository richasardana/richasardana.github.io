Needed side tables. Don't have any carpentary experience but really wanted to build something. After wasting a lot of time online, here is what I came up with - hair pin leg tables with solid wood cutting boards as table tops!

# Supplies
Any solid wood cutting board of the size of your choosing. I used a 13" x 18" x 3/4" wood board.

Hair pin legs of the height of your choosing. I used 28" (Black) 3/8" Thick Metal Steel Leg Set for 4.

Wood screws of a depth less than the thickness of the wood. I used #8 x 5/8" Antique Brass Truss Interior Wood Screws. 

Drill machine, drill bits and screw driver.

Top coat of your choosing (to protect the table surface).

# The process
Select the face that will be the underside of the table top. Measure out and mark the spots where you want to afix the legs. Using the smallest size drill bit, pre-drill 1/2" holes. Then using a screw driver, attach the legs. Turn the table upside down, apply three coats of the top coat (allow it to dry between each coat, and sand it finely if you so choose). Side table ready for use!
