Recipes on the internet are easy to find but harder to keep track of and remember. Sometimes Sid and I find one we like and then tweak to fit our liking. We figured why not create a website that logs them in a easy to use and interactive fashion. We came up with this static website using [Gochowdown](https://github.com/seanlane/gochowdown) theme for Hugo. Gochowdown was itself built on [Chowdown](https://github.com/clarklab/chowdown) for Jekyll. The hope is to experiment more with not just cooking but also with Jekyll and Hugo. Here is the link: [Richa and Sid's Recipe Blog](https://richa-sid-recipe-blog.netlify.app).
