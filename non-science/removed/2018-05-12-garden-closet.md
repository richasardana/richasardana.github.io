A bit of color and art in our backyard has made it a happier place. Did this back in 2017, and it is holding up quite well. The mural decorates the door of our garden closet. It took several weeks (mostly because of the weather, time constraints etc.) to finish, and has opened endless possibilities for what all we want to cover in murals in and around the house! Can't find a pic of how it looked before (or maybe we forgot to click one, but it was a plain wooden cabinet), but here is one of the final product. 

<!--
<div class="card-columns">
    {% for img in page.images %}
    <div class="card" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#exampleModal" data-img="{{ img }}">
        <img class="card-img-top" src="{{ img }}" />
    </div>
    {% endfor %}
</div>


<div class="modal fade" id="exampleModal">
  <div class="modal-dialog modal-lg modal-dialog-centered">
    <div class="modal-content">
      <div class="modal-body">
        <img class="modal-img w-100" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#exampleModal').on('show.bs.modal', function (event) {
      var button = $(event.relatedTarget)
      var img = button.data('img')
      var modal = $(this)
      modal.find('.modal-img').attr('src', img)
    })
  })
</script>
