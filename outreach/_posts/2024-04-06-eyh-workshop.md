Sardana lab participates in the yearly 'Expand your horizons' community outreach program at Cornell to encourage girls to pursue STEM careers. We teach the high school girls key concepts in microscopy. This followed by all participants building a simple microscope and observing a diversity of interesting specimens. These workshops have been very successful with the students, and very rewarding for us!

Apr, 2023: Sardana lab organized two hands-on workshops for 9th grade Ithaca high school girls on building and using a simple mircroscope. 

Apr, 2024: Sardana lab organized three hands-on workshops for 7th/ 8th grade Ithaca high school girls on the principles of microscopy. 

Apr, 2025: Sardana lab organized three hands-on workshops for 7th/ 8th grade Ithaca high school girls on the principles of microscopy this year again. Students enjoyed and appreciated the workshops!
